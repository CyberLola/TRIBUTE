DEPLOY THE MACHINE!!!

TASK#1 - SCAN

The first thing we need to do is run a nmap to looks for open ports, vulnerabilities, operating systems and versions.

I like to use the command

nmap -sV -sC --script=vuln <insert here the target's IP>

You could also insert the flag -O to find operating systems, but it requires you to run nmap as sudo.

For a comprehensive guide on nmap usage, refer to https://nmap.org/book/toc.html

Going through the finished scan, we can find all the answers for the first 5 questions of task#1. 

For the last question, you can find the answer with a very simple, basic OSINT (or maybe you were paying attention in History class!)



TASK#2 - GET IN

We found very valuable information during our nmap scan, so it's time to use what we gathered to exploit this machine.

My chosen way to exploit it is through Metasploit Framework, since I really like Metasploit (sorry, Offensive Security) 

So let's start it by typing the command

msfconsole

Next, we search for our found vulnerability using the command

search CVE-2015-3306

There is only one result, so we will use that! The command is very simple

use 0

You will notice that the module was added to the prompt in red characters.

We still need to get some things ready before we can run our exploit, so we type

show options

Here we need to set the RHOST (remote host, which is our target machine's IP).
